# UdaciCards Project by Janis Zalitis

This is my submission for Udacity's React Fundamentals course last Project - UdaciCards.
It has been developed and tested on iOS simulator (iPhone X) and an iPhone SE device.
Project was linted using AirBnB ESLint config with some local modifications.

## TL;DR

To start app:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`
* use iOS simulator or iPhone with Expo app to test

Scenarios:
* Decks -> Click on Deck -> Add New Card
* Decks -> Click on Deck -> Start Quiz (proceed until done)
* New Deck -> Enter new deck title -> Click submit -> Proceed as in previous scenarios
